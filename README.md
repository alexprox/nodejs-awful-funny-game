nodejs-awful-funny-game
=======================

This game was "created" years ago (now.js). Now it is rewritten (only socket part) to socket.io (1.2.0).

For users: it is buggy, but funny. 

For developers: DO NOT OPEN CODE, IT CAN BE HARMFUL!!!

1. You need to write your IP at `client.html`
2. `node server.js`
3. Done
